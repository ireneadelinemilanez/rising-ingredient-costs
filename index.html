			<p class="intro">Prices of wholesale ingredients continue to increase because of new tariffs imposed by the current administration and rising inflation. Small restaurant owners in Brooklyn, particularly those who are Black or immigrant, are scrambling to rebalance their bottom lines.</p>			
			<!-- Regular body paragraph -->

			<p>Brooklyn Suya co-owner Hema Agwu said the price of meat has increased the most. "I would say proteins go up every year," Agwu said.</p>
			<p>His restaurant in Crown Heights serves suya, a grilled protein seasoned with a signature Nigerian blend of roasted peanuts and dried chilies, bowl-style over a bed of kale or rice, topped with fresh vegetables.</p>
			<p>Like Agwu, Hibist Legesse, owner of Bati Ethiopian Kitchen in Bed-Stuy, also said she has seen a steady rise in protein costs.</p>
			<p>"As an ethnic restaurant, you can only charge so much," she said. "You don't want to push away your customers like that. So we just keep our prices the same, and we eat the cost most of the time."</p>
			<p>Jamila Wright, co-founder of Brooklyn Tea, imports teas from around the world to sell in their cafes and online store. She said the combined effects of tariffs and rising shipping costs have made her operations increasingly difficult because many of her products come from abroad.</p>
			<p>"Our oolong teas are now in flux, because Taiwan no longer ships to the U.S. due to the high demands around tariffs," Wright said. "That just changes our entire menu."</p>
			<p>Akin Akinsanya organizes African Restaurant Week, an annual event aimed at connecting local restaurants with their communities. This year, the festival was held at Bed-Stuy's Restoration Plaza. </p>
			<p>"It's very difficult for businesses," Akinsanya said. "You set up a business to service any kind of community, and within five years, that community is no longer there."</p>
