			<p class="intro">As prices continue to rise, small restaurant owners in Brooklyn are grappling with soaring ingredient costs. Brooklyn Suya co-owner Hema Agwu said the price of meat has increased the most.</p>
			
			<!-- Regular body paragraph -->

			<p>"I would say proteins go up every year. "Steak is super expensive. Salmon is super expensive," Agwu said.</p>
			<p>His restaurant in Crown Heights serves suya, a grilled protein seasoned with a signature Nigerian blend of roasted peanuts and dried chilies, bowl-style over a bed of kale or rice, topped with fresh vegetables. Agwu said steak and salmon are their most popular proteins.</p>
			<p>Like Agwu, Hibist Legesse, owner of Bati Ethiopian Kitchen in Bed-Stuy, also said  she has seen a steady rise in protein costs.</p>
			<p>"As an ethnic restaurant, you can only charge so much," she said. "You don't want to push away your customers like that. So we just keep our prices the same, and we eat the cost most of the time." </p>
			<p>Akin Akinsanya organizes African Restaurant Week, an annual event aimed at connecting local restaurants with their communities. This year, the festival was held at Bed-Stuy's Restoration Plaza. </p>
			<p>"It's very difficult for businesses," Akinsanya said. "You set up a business to service any kind of community, and within five years, that community is no longer there."</p>
